Hello, I'm Lu Jiejie (陆解解/鹿姐姐).

I am enthusiastic about open-source development, you can find a selection of my projects [here](/projects), or explore all of them on my [GitHub](/github).

I wanted a space to capture the moments of my life and leave traces of my existence, which is why I created this blog.
